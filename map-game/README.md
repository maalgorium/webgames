This is a game for naming the countries of a world. It consists of a single page, which has
a map of the world, showing the countries in outline. Above that is a text entry box where
the user can enter country names. When the user enters the correct name of a country, the country is
filled in.

Below the map are several alphabetical lists of the countries by continent, side by side. At the beginning,
all of the entries are blank. When the user enters the correct name of a country, the name of
that country appears in the list.

When the user begins typing in the text entry box a timer begins.

There is a reset button to start over.

The game should be a single HTML file.
